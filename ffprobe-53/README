DESCRIPTION
===========

FF-probe is a simple multimedia streams analyzer with a command-line 
interface based on the FFmpeg project libraries.

FFmpeg web site is available at:
http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/

DOWNLOAD
========

This program is hosted at sourceforge. In order to get the last development
snapshot use the command:
svn co https://ffprobe.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ffprobe/trunk ffprobe

PREREQUISITES
=============

In order to compile this package you need Gnu autoconf, a development 
environment (C compiler and make) and a working installation of the FFmpeg 
libav* libraries with these version constraints:

libavutil >= 49.4.1
libavcodec >= 51.40.4
libavformat >= 51.12.1

which are shipped with FFmpeg SVN >= 9401.

Since many systems come with many libav* installations check that you're
building against the correct headers and libraries.

The features of the resulting ffprobe compiled binary will depend on the
features of the corresponding libav* libraries.

In order to run the scripts in the tools dir you need a perl interpreter.

INSTALLATION
============

This package uses Gnu autotools for packaging.

In order to build and install follow the usual procedure:
./configure --help
./configure [<options>]
make
make install

In the case the configure file is missing, you need Gnu autoconf to build
it from configure.in: run the autoconf command to do it.

Also look the INSTALL file for more detailed instructions.

If this procedure fails, please send a bug report to the author[s] of the
package (look in the AUTHORS file).
